Whoever\r\n\t * instantiates a transaction can provide enforcers of the invariants at\r\n\t * creation time. The `Transaction` class itself will supply one additional\r\n\t * automatic invariant for you - the invariant that any transaction instance\r\n\t * should not be run while it is already being run. You would typically create a\r\n\t * single instance of a `Transaction` for reuse multiple times, that potentially\r\n\t * is used to wrap several different methods. Wrappers are extremely simple -\r\n\t * they only require implementing two methods.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * <pre>\r\n\t *                       wrappers (injected at creation time)\r\n\t *                                      +        +\r\n\t *                                      |        |\r\n\t *                    +-----------------|--------|--------------+\r\n\t *                    |                 v        |              |\r\n\t *                    |      +---------------+   |              |\r\n\t *                    |   +--|    wrapper1   |---|----+         |\r\n\t *                    |   |  +---------------+   v    |         |\r\n\t *                    |   |          +-------------+  |         |\r\n\t *                    |   |     +----|   wrapper2  |--------+   |\r\n\t *                    |   |     |    +-------------+  |     |   |\r\n\t *                    |   |     |                     |     |   |\r\n\t *                    |   v     v                     v     v   | wrapper\r\n\t *                    | +---+ +---+   +---------+   +---+ +---+ | invariants\r\n\t * perform(anyMethod) | |   | |   |   |         |   |   | |   | | maintained\r\n\t * +----------------->|-|---|-|---|-->|anyMethod|---|---|-|---|-|-------->\r\n\t *                    | |   | |   |   |         |   |   | |   | |\r\n\t *                    | |   | |   |   |         |   |   | |   | |\r\n\t *                    | |   | |   |   |         |   |   | |   | |\r\n\t *                    | +---+ +---+   +---------+   +---+ +---+ |\r\n\t *                    |  initialize                    close    |\r\n\t *                    +-----------------------------------------+\r\n\t * </pre>\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Use cases:\r\n\t * - Preserving the input selection ranges before/after reconciliation.\r\n\t *   Restoring selection even in the event of an unexpected error.\r\n\t * - Deactivating events while rearranging the DOM, preventing blurs/focuses,\r\n\t *   while guaranteeing that afterwards, the event system is reactivated.\r\n\t * - Flushing a queue of collected DOM mutations to the main UI thread after a\r\n\t *   reconciliation takes place in a worker thread.\r\n\t * - Invoking any collected `componentDidUpdate` callbacks after rendering new\r\n\t *   content.\r\n\t * - (Future use case): Wrapping particular flushes of the `ReactWorker` queue\r\n\t *   to preserve the `scrollTop` (an automatic scroll aware DOM).\r\n\t * - (Future use case): Layout calculations before and after DOM updates.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Transactional plugin API:\r\n\t * - A module that has an `initialize` method that returns any precomputation.\r\n\t * - and a `close` method that accepts the precomputation. `close` is invoked\r\n\t *   when the wrapped process is completed, or has failed.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * @param {Array<TransactionalWrapper>} transactionWrapper Wrapper modules\r\n\t * that implement `initialize` and `close`.\r\n\t * @return {Transaction} Single transaction for reuse in thread.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * @class Transaction\r\n\t */\r\n\tvar Mixin = {\r\n\t  /**\r\n\t   * Sets up this instance so that it is prepared for collecting metrics.
